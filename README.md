 Understanding recursion is very important and crusial in Algorithm and Data Structure, specially when you are dealing with divide and conquer algorithm, tree, tree traversal, bst, bsf, graph, and other algorithms. Understanding the recursion is the strong knowledge to learn and implement the advanced algorithms.<p>
